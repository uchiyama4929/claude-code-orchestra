# Delegation-First Rule

**The main agent's default answer to "who does this work?" is *not me*.**

This rule is normative and tool-neutral. It governs *whether* to delegate and
*to whom*. `.agents/rules/runtime-compatibility.md` maps logical routes to the
current runtime; `.agents/rules/codex-delegation.md` covers cross-runtime Codex
handoffs; `.agents/rules/tiers.md` defines the tiers.

## Default Posture

Delegate by default. Direct execution by the main agent is the **exception**,
and every exception must be justified by the Self-Handle List below. The main
agent's scarce resource is context and judgment, not tokens: work it performs
itself is work whose intermediate output permanently occupies the conversation.

## Self-Handle List (closed)

The main agent does the work itself **only** when the whole task is one of:

1. Answering from context already loaded this session — no new file reading.
2. A single-file edit of roughly 20 lines or fewer, in a file whose exact
   location and current contents are already known.
3. Running a named command or gate and reporting its result:
   `.agents/skills/_shared/verify.sh`, `.agents/skills/_shared/run_tests.py`,
   `.agents/check.sh`, `git status` / `diff` / `commit` / `push`.
4. Deterministic skill-bundled scripts a `SKILL.md` explicitly assigns to the
   lead (`workspace.py`, `validate_doc.py`, `update_design.py`,
   `append_state_block.py`, `checkpoint.py`, `collect_repo_state.py`, …).
5. User interaction: clarifying questions, approvals, routing decisions,
   integration of returned results, and the final Japanese report.

The list is closed. "It would be faster to just do it myself" is not on it, and
neither is "the task is small enough that delegating feels like overhead."

## Mandatory Delegation Triggers

Delegate as soon as **any** of these holds — do not investigate first and then
decide:

- Three or more files must be read, **or** any file must be read whose contents
  are not already in this session's context.
- The expected output exceeds roughly 30 lines of code or prose.
- Locations are unknown and finding them needs a codebase-wide search sweep.
- Current external information must be verified (docs, APIs, releases).
- A command failed and its root cause is not already proven by evidence in hand.
- Design, step decomposition, trade-off evaluation, or complex implementation is
  involved.
- Two or more independent workstreams exist in the request.

## Route Selection

| Work | Route |
|------|-------|
| Routine, well-scoped implementation with clear acceptance criteria | `general-purpose-sonnet` |
| Ambiguous, cross-cutting, security / concurrency / data-integrity / migration-sensitive implementation | `general-purpose-opus` |
| Codebase-wide investigation, large-context analysis, external research | `general-purpose-opus` |
| Unknown root cause, failing tests or builds, unexpected behaviour | `codex-debugger` |
| Architecture, planning, decomposition, complex algorithms, code review | Native deep route (`codex-system`; Claude may use `codex_consult.py`, Codex works directly) |
| Repeated failure, conflicting proposals, final review of a large change | `fable-advisor` (rare) |

Escalate rather than retry: a `general-purpose-sonnet` task that comes back
wrong or under-specified goes to `general-purpose-opus` or Codex, not back to
the same tier with the same prompt.

## Parallel by Default

When two or more delegable units are independent, launch them **in a single
message** so they run concurrently. Sequential delegation is reserved for
genuine data dependency — when the next prompt cannot be written without the
previous result. Typical parallel splits: investigation vs. external research,
implementation vs. test authoring, per-module ownership, review dimensions
(security / quality / test coverage).

## Subagent Prompt Contract

Every delegation carries all six, in the delegating message:

1. **Objective** — one sentence, the decision the result must enable.
2. **Scope** — what is in, what is explicitly out, what must not be touched.
3. **Inputs** — explicit file paths, plus the rules the subagent must load.
4. **Acceptance checks** — the exact commands that prove the work is done.
5. **Output shape** — the sections required in the reply.
6. **Context discipline** — "return only decision-relevant findings; write long
   output to `.agents/docs/…` or `.agents/logs/…` and return the path."

A subagent that had to guess any of the six was under-specified by the caller.

## Context Discipline

Long logs, large files, and full search dumps never enter the main agent's
context. Delegate the reading, have the subagent persist the durable artifact,
and take back the summary plus the path.

## Verification Stays With the Caller

Delegation transfers the work, never the accountability. Before reporting any
delegated result as done:

- run the acceptance checks from the prompt contract yourself;
- inspect the diff (`.agents/skills/_shared/verify_delegation.py`,
  `git diff --stat`) for out-of-scope edits, deletions, and placeholders;
- apply the guardrails in `.agents/rules/cli-execution.md` section "Guardrails
  (Completion Verification)" — weakened or skipped tests, swallowed exceptions,
  and hardcoded return values are rejections, not completions.

Report a delegated result as verified only when you ran the check that proves it.

## Anti-Patterns

- Investigating "just enough to understand it" and then delegating nothing —
  the investigation *was* the delegable work.
- Splitting one delegable task into a long chain of main-agent tool calls.
- Reading a file in the main agent so the subagent prompt can quote it; pass the
  path instead.
- Over-delegation: one subagent per trivial edit, or a delegation whose prompt
  takes longer to write than the edit would. Item 2 of the Self-Handle List
  exists for exactly these.
- Delegating a decision that is the user's to make.
