"""Validate a skill-produced markdown document against a named section contract.

One engine for every skill deliverable that must contain specific headings —
work logs, library docs, plans, briefs, reports, checkpoint summaries, guides —
so document contracts live in a single registry rather than as a one-off
validator per document type. Use ``--contract work-log`` for the Agent Teams
teammate work log defined in ``work-log-format.md`` (implementer/reviewer
variant auto-detected); ``--contract feature-brief`` likewise auto-detects the
MODE=existing / MODE=greenfield variant.

Each contract's required headings are taken verbatim from the template (or, for
``plan-doc``, the SKILL.md output format) that declares them;
``tests/test_validate_doc.py`` validates those templates against their contract
so the two cannot drift apart. ``design-doc`` and ``state-doc`` have no separate
template: their reference document *is* the seed
``.agents/docs/DESIGN.md`` / ``.agents/STATE.md`` that ``scripts/install.sh``
copies into a project, and both are project-owned and mutable afterwards, so
each requires only the sections their writers (``update_design.py``,
``append_state_block.py``, ``refresh_guard.py``) depend on rather than every
heading the seed happens to contain. A contract may additionally require
machine-readable metadata lines (``lib-doc`` requires the
``> **Last Updated**:`` / ``> **Version Checked**:`` blockquote that
``update-lib-docs/lib_inventory.py`` parses); those are reported in
``metadata_missing``.

Usage:
    python3 validate_doc.py --contract lib-doc --file path/to/doc.md
    python3 validate_doc.py --contract work-log --dir path/to/team-dir/
    python3 validate_doc.py --contract work-log --dir path/to/team-dir/ \
        --expect-files 3

``--expect-files N`` states how many ``*.md`` files the caller requires in
``--dir``. Without it, an empty directory is reported as
``files_checked: 0`` with a warning and stays exit 0 — "no teammate wrote a
log" would otherwise be indistinguishable from "every log is valid".
``--expect-files`` is only meaningful with ``--dir``; combining it with
``--file`` is a bad-argument error (exit 1) rather than a silently ignored flag.

Exit codes:
    0  ok — the file(s) satisfy the contract
    1  bad args, unknown contract, or path does not exist / unreadable
    2  contract violation — a required section or metadata line is missing, or
       --expect-files was not satisfied
