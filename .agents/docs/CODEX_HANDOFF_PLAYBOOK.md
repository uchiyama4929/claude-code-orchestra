# Cross-Runtime Codex Handoff Playbook

This document standardizes how another runtime hands tasks to Codex. When the
current runtime is Codex, perform the work natively and do not use the external
CLI recipes below.

## Goals

- Reduce retries caused by ambiguous Codex prompts.
- Keep the caller's context small by returning concise summaries.
- Make Codex responses immediately actionable in the shared workflow.

## 1) Delegation Decision Matrix

Use Codex when **at least one** is true:

- Architecture or module boundary decisions are involved.
- The implementation requires multiple dependent steps.
- The error root cause is unknown.
- Trade-off comparison is required.
- The change affects 2+ files with behavioral impact.

Skip Codex when all are true:

- Single-file, obvious edit.
- <10 LOC change.
- No design decision or risk.

## 2) Prompt Contract (Required Fields)

Every Codex prompt should include:

1. **Objective**: one-sentence outcome.
2. **Constraints**: language, style, forbidden approaches.
3. **Relevant files**: explicit paths.
4. **Acceptance checks**: commands to run.
5. **Output format**: concise markdown sections.

> Invoke Codex through `.agents/skills/_shared/codex_consult.py` rather than a bare `codex exec` call — it runs `codex exec` with stdin closed (so callers never need `< /dev/null`) and captures stdout/stderr to log files. See `.agents/skills/codex-system/SKILL.md` for the full invocation contract.

## 3) Recommended Prompt Templates

### A. Planning / Design (read-only)

```bash
prompt_file="$(mktemp)"
cat > "${prompt_file}" << 'EOF'
Objective: Create an implementation plan for {feature}.
Constraints:
- Keep existing architecture unless explicitly justified.
- Prefer minimal diff.
Relevant files:
- {file1}
- {file2}
Acceptance checks:
- {test or lint commands}
Output format:
## Analysis
## Recommendation
## Implementation Plan
## Risks
## Next Steps
EOF
python3 .agents/skills/_shared/codex_consult.py --prompt-file "${prompt_file}" --label plan --sandbox read-only
```

### B. Complex Implementation (danger-full-access)

```bash
prompt_file="$(mktemp)"
cat > "${prompt_file}" << 'EOF'
Objective: Implement {feature/fix}.
Constraints:
- Follow project lint/type/test rules.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
Relevant files:
- {file1}
- {file2}
Acceptance checks:
- {test or lint commands}
Output format:
## Changes Made
## Validation
## Remaining Risks
EOF
python3 .agents/skills/_shared/codex_consult.py --prompt-file "${prompt_file}" --label implement --sandbox danger-full-access
```

## 4) Caller-side Compression Rules

When Codex finishes, the caller should keep only:

- Top recommendation.
- 3-5 implementation steps.
- Risks requiring user decision.

Store long analysis in `.agents/docs/research/` and reference the path in user-facing updates.

## 5) Failure Recovery

If Codex output is not actionable:

1. Re-run with explicit file list and acceptance checks.
2. Split into two calls: `read-only` plan → `danger-full-access` implementation.
3. Ask Codex to compare exactly two options and choose one.

## 6) Claude-only Codex Plugin Workflows (codex-plugin-cc)

When Claude Code has `openai/codex-plugin-cc` installed, these structured
workflows are available. They do not apply inside Codex.

### A. Review Before Shipping

```bash
# Quick review of current changes
/codex:review

# Review branch diff against main
/codex:review --base main

# Background review (non-blocking)
/codex:review --background
/codex:status          # Check progress
/codex:result          # Get results
```

### B. Adversarial Review (Challenge Design)

```bash
# Challenge implementation and design decisions
/codex:adversarial-review

# Focus on specific risk areas
/codex:adversarial-review --background look for race conditions and question the chosen approach
```

### C. Task Delegation (Rescue)

```bash
# Investigate a bug
/codex:rescue investigate why the tests started failing

# Fix with minimal patch
/codex:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch

# Continue previous task
/codex:rescue --resume apply the top fix from the last run

# Use specific model/effort
/codex:rescue --model gpt-5.5-mini --effort medium investigate the flaky test
```

### D. Plugin vs Direct CLI Decision

Use **Plugin** when:
- You need structured review (code review, adversarial review)
- You want background execution with job tracking
- You want to delegate and monitor a task

Use **Direct CLI** (the wrapper) when:
- You need custom prompt format with specific output structure
- You need sandbox mode control (read-only vs danger-full-access)
- You are calling from a subagent pattern
